Hi quitters! I'm Matan and I'm the creator of an app called Smoke Breaker 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smokebreaker.www

The app is pretty new and I need some feedback. 
It would help me a lot if you guys would download it, use it a bit and send me some feedback (there's a button just for this on the menu).

What you get: 
- track your smoking.
- chat with other quitters.
- get and share tips.
- get custom tailored suggested smoke breaks times.
- gain achievements.

Thanks to all the helpers and may you all quit forever !
